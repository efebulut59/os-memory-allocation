# Memory Allocation Algorithms

This project implements classic memory allocation strategies using linked lists.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit
- Next Fit

## Memory Model
The system simulates a memory of 100 units (0–99).
Free memory blocks are represented as [start, length].

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the allocator file:

```bash
python src/memory_allocator.py
```
